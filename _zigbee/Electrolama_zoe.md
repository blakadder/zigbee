zoe is a 802.15.4/Zigbee development board designed to be used alongside a Raspberry Pi. It follows the Raspberry Pi HAT Mechanical specification but it does not have the ID EEPROM therefore it is not technically a HAT. 

No external programmer is required for flashing the Zigbee module thanks to [flash-cc2531](https://github.com/jmichault/flash_cc2531), a bitbanged implementation of the Chipcon programming protocol.
