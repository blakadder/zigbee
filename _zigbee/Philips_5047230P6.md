I can confirm that it works with both HomeAssistant and ioBroker.
To make it work you have to reset the lamp allowing it to connect to your Zigbee device.
To reset it, simply press the top and bottom buttons on the remote control at the same time for 30 seconds.
The reset is confirmed by the lights flashing and changing color.
