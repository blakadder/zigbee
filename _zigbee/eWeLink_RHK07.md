#### Tasmota Configuration

After pairing requires [binding](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Zigbee/#zigbee-binding) to display events in Tasmota Console. 

To bind to coordinator on cluster 6 (on/off) use:
```console
ZbBind {"Device":"<shortaddr>","ToDevice":"0x0000","Endpoint":1,"ToEndpoint":1,"Cluster":6}
```
